# Documentation
## Folder Structure
- src/ holds all implementation code, split into logical packages.
- scripts/ are your command-line helpers for data collection, prioritization and evaluation.
- data/ stores the coverage database (and any history you need).
- tests/ contains both your dummy/example tests and, eventually, real ones.
